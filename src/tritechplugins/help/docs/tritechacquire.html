	<h1>Tritech Sonars</h1>
	<h2>Acquisition</h2>
	<h3>Add the module</h3>
	<p>Once the Tritech plugin is installed, from the File / Add
		modules menu, select Tritech / Tritech Acquisition. Only one Tritech
		acquisition module can be added to a PAMguard configuration.</p>

	<h3>Acquiring real time sonar data</h3>

	<h4>Connecting the sonars</h4>

	<p>Read the Tritech manual !</p>

	<p>Data from Tritech sonars are acquired over Ethernet. Generally
		it is best to use a separate Ethernet port to the one you use to
		connect your computer to the Internet. If you're on a laptop, you'll
		probably be using WiFi to connect to the Internet, so if you have an
		Ethernet port on your laptop, you can use that for the sonar(s). If
		you don't have an Ethernet port, or are already using the port for
		Internet access, then purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter. These are
		readily available for USB3 and USB-C from many retailers.</p>

	<p>If you're using more than one sonar (you can have up to four)
		then use a USB switch to connect multiple sonars to the one Ethernet
		port on your computer</p>

	<p>By default, most Ethernet adapters will try to get an Internet
		address from the router they are connected to. This won't with the
		sonars, so you need to configure the adapter to use a fixed ip
		address.</p>


	<p>
		The PAMGuard module cannot fully configure Tritech sonars ip
		addresses. You should first therefore use the <a
			href="https://www.tritech.co.uk/support/software/genesis">Tritech
			Genesis software</a> to set these up and test the sonars. Make sure that
		PAMGuard is not running while you do this, since only one program can
		connect to the sonars at a time. Follow the Tritech instructions. Once
		it's working in Genesis, close Genesis and re-open PAMGuard. Apart from the
		ip addresses, everything else can be configured from within PAMGuard.
