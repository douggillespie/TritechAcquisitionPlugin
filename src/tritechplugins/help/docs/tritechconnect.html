	<h1>Tritech Sonars</h1>
	<br>
	<p>If you are only interested in processing data from archived
		files, or are just using the PAMGuard viewer to review sonar data,
		then you don't need to follow the instructions below, which are only
		for acquiring and processing sonar data in real time.</p>

	<h2>Connecting Sonars</h2>


	<p>Read the Tritech manual !</p>

	<p>Data from Tritech sonars are acquired over Ethernet. Generally
		it is best to use a separate Ethernet port to the one you use to
		connect your computer to the Internet. If you're on a laptop, you'll
		probably be using WiFi to connect to the Internet, so if you have an
		Ethernet port on your laptop, you can use that for the sonar(s). If
		you don't have an Ethernet port, or are already using the port for
		Internet access, then purchase a USB to Ethernet adapter. These are
		readily available for USB3 and USB-C from many retailers.</p>

	<p>If you're using more than one sonar (you can have up to four)
		then use a USB switch to connect multiple sonars to the one Ethernet
		port on your computer</p>

	<p>By default, most Ethernet adapters will try to get an Internet
		address from the router they are connected to. This won't with the
		sonars, so you need to configure the adapter to use a fixed ip
		address.</p>


	<p>
		The PAMGuard module cannot fully configure Tritech sonars ip
		addresses. You should first therefore use the <a
			href="https://www.tritech.co.uk/support/software/genesis">Tritech
			Genesis software</a> to set these up and test the sonars. Make sure that
		PAMGuard is not running while you do this, since only one program can
		connect to the sonars at a time. Follow the Tritech instructions. Once
		it's working in Genesis, close Genesis and re-open PAMGuard. Apart
		from the ip addresses, everything else can be configured from within
		PAMGuard.
	</p>

	<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
	<p>If you haven't successfully connected to a sonar using Genesis,
		then you will not be able to connect to that sonar with PAMGuard.</p>
	<p>If the sonars are working in Genesis, but not in PAMGuard, then
		it's likely that one of three things is happening:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>You have not correctly installed the software libraries. Go
			back to <a href="tritechoverview.html">the installation
				instructions</a> and check that all libraries are in the correct folder.
		</li>
		<li>Genesis is still running, or you are running two PAMGuard
			with Tritech Acquisition at the same time. The Tritech software only
			allows one program to connect to a sonar at any one time, so check
			other programmes are closes.</li>
		<li>The firmware version (that the software on the sonars
			themselves) is new and currently unsupported. <a
			href="https://www.pamguard.org/contact.html">Contact the PAMGuard
				team.</a>
		</li>
	</ol>
