	<h1>Sonar Displays</h1>
	<br>
	<p>
		The Tritech modules do not automatically create any displays
		automatically added to the PAMGuard <a
			href="_mainHelp_overview/PamMasterHelp/docs/guiOverview.html">Graphical
			User Interface</a>. You should create a new <a
			href="_mainHelp_displays/userDisplayHelp/docs/userDisplayPanel.html">User
			Display Panel</a> (as you would to add a spectrogram display to PAMGuard)
		and add display components to the User Display Panel. This allows more
		flexibility than a standard fixed display format, since you can
		combine the sonar displays with displays from other modules. e.g. if
		you were collecting both sonar data and PAM data, you could have a
		sonar display and a <a
			href="_mainHelp_displays/spectrogramDisplayHelp/docs/UserDisplay_Spectrogram.html">spectrogram
			display</a> on the same panel.
	</p>

	<h2>Main Sonar Image Display</h2>
	<img src="images/SonarDisplay.png">
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>If multiple sonars are in use, the display will show the image
		for each sonar separately.</p>

	<h4>Sonar status panel</h4>
	<p>The sonar status is shown in the top left corner. If multiple
		sonars are in use, this panel will expand to show all devices. The
		panel can be hidden to give a complete view of the main sonar display
		using the small button in the top right hand corner.</p>

	<h4>Processing files</h4>
	<p>If your processing data from files, rather than real time
		acquisition, the status panel will not show and instead a small
		toolbar at the top of the display will show progress through the file
		archive. Here you can also select how fast the analysis will proceed.
		Free run will cause the system to process data as fast as possible.
		Selecting other speeds can be useful for viewing and demonstrating
		data as it processes.</p>

	<h4>Display options</h4>
	<p>Display options are in the bottom right hand corner. These can
		also be hidden using the small button in the corner of this panel. The
		main options panel shows options that you might want to change often.
		Click on the settings cog for further options.</p>
	<p>Once hidden, in the same part of the screen as the display
		options is information about individual frames.</p>
	<h4>Zoom control</h4>
	<p>You can zoom in on a region of the sonar image using the mouse
		scroll wheel.</p>
	<h4>Overlays</h4>
	<p>Right click on the display for options to display detector and
		other overlays on the display. The options available will depend on
		which detectors are included in your PAMGuard configuration, and how
		they are configured.</p>
	<h4>Viewer mode</h4>
	<p>When using the display in Viewer mode, appearance and available
		controls will change slightly showing a scroll bar and standard
		PAMGuard data scrolling tools. An internal map of raw sonar data is
		created for the time period of the scroller, though raw sonar data is
		only loaded for a single record at a time.</p>

	<br>
	<br>
	<h2>Frame Rate Display</h2>
	<p>
		<img src="images/framerate.png">
	</p>
	<p>This display shows a histogram and a scrolling time display of
		the frame rate. If the frame rate is unstable or is lower than you
		expected you may have to improve your Ethernet connection to the
		sonar(s) or accept working at a lower ping rate.</p>

	<br>
	<h2>Signal Level Display</h2>
	<p>This is part of the detection system, so is only available when
		the detector module is loaded</p>
	<p>
		<img src="images/thresholdhistogram.png">
	</p>
	<p>
		The signal levels in the sonar can be adjusted by changing the gain in
		the <a href="tritechacquire.html">Acquisition dialog</a> (note that
		this is not the same as the gain in the display options panel).
	</p>
	<p>Two lines are shown in the histogram. The 'raw' line is the
		level of data coming out of the sonar, and the 'treated' line is the
		level after background subtraction in the detector.</p>
	<p>If the gain is too high, the the data will be distorted. On the
		other hand, if the gain is too low, faint objects may not be visible.
		Ideally, the signal should use most of the dynamic range of the
		system. Ideally, the raw data should fill most of the dynamic range of
		the system - so in the example here, where the raw data levels reach a value 
		of about 130 (out maximum of 255) it might be possible to increase the gain 
		slightly. </p>
