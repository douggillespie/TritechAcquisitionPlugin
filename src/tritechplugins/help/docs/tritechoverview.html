	<h1>Tritech Sonars</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		The Tritech Sonars modules can be used to acquire and process data
		from <a href="https://www.tritech.co.uk/products/multibeam-sonars">Tritech
			Multibeam imaging sonars</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Currently, three modules are available to
	<ul>
		<li><a href="tritechacquire.html">Acquire sonar data</a> (in real
			time or from file)</li>
		<li><a href="tritechdetect.html">Automatically detect tracks</a>
			in the sonar data</li>
		<li><a href="tritechrecord.html">Record sonar data</a> to archive
			files for later analysis</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>If you're reading this in the PAMGuard Help, it's likely that
		you've already installed everything and don't need to do any more. If
		you're updating, or are having difficulties, then read on.</p>
	<p>All three modules are packaged into a single PAMguard plugin,
		called something like TritechAcquisitionV*_**.jar, where *_** is the
		version number. This does not come as a standard part of a PAMGuard
		installation.</p>
	<p>To acquire data directly from sonars, you also need some Windows
		library files to manage communication between PAMGuard and the Tritech
		devices.</p>
	<p>
		Both the TritechAcquisitionV*_**.jar plugin and the required libraries
		are distributed together in zip archives <a
			href="https://github.com/douggillespie/TritechAcquisitionPlugin/releases">through
			GitHub</a>
	<p>Follow the instructions for the latest GitHub release ensuring
		that you copy files to the correct folders in your PAMGuard
		installation.</p>
