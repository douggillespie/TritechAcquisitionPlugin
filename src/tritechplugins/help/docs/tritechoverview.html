	<h1>Tritech Sonars</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>
		The Tritech Sonars modules can be used to acquire and process data
		from <a href="https://www.tritech.co.uk/products/multibeam-sonars">Tritech
			Multibeam imaging sonars</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Currently, three modules are available to
	<ul>
		<li><a href="tritechacquire.html">Acquire sonar data</a> (in real
			time or from file, just like the PAMGuard acquisition module)</li>
		<li><a href="tritechdetect.html">Automatically detect tracks</a>
			in the sonar data</li>
		<li><a href="tritechrecord.html">Record sonar data</a> to archive
			files for later analysis</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>All three modules are packaged into a single PAMguard plugin,
		called something like TritechAcquisitionV*_**.jar, where *_** is the
		version number. This does not come as a standard part of a PAMGuard
		installation. 
		
		Read  / copy the stuff in the released zip file. 
		
		To add Tritech modules to an installation, you should
		add the latest TritechAcquisitionV*_**.jar file to the plugins folder
		of your PAMGuard installation. The modules will then appear the next
		time you start PAMGuard.</p>
		<p>If you plan to use the module for real time acquisition from Tritech sonars
		you also need to install a number of library files ...</p>
